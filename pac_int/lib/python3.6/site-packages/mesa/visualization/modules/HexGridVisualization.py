Modular Canvas Rendering
========================

Module for visualizing model objects in hexagonal grid cells.

    """ A CanvasHexGrid object functions similarly to a CanvasGrid object. It takes a portrayal dictionary and talks to HexDraw.js to draw that shape.

    A portrayal as a dictionary with the following structure:
        "x", "y": Coordinates for the cell in which the object is placed.
        "Shape": Can be either "hex" or "circle"
            "r": The radius, defined as a fraction of cell size. r=1 will
                 fill the entire cell.
        "Color": The color to draw the shape in; needs to be a valid HTML
                 color, e.g."Red" or "#AA08F8"
        "Filled": either "true" or "false", and determines whether the shape is
                  filled or not.
        "Layer": Layer number of 0 or above; higher-numbered layers are drawn
                 above lower-numbered layers.
        "text": The text to be inscribed inside the Shape. Normally useful for
                showing the unique_id of the agent.
        "text_color": The color to draw the inscribed text. Should be given in
                      conjunction of "text" property.


    Attributes:
        portrayal_method: Function which generates portrayals from objects, as
                          described above.
        grid_height, grid_width: Size of the grid to visualize, in cells.
        canvas_height, canvas_width: Size, in pixels, of the grid visualization
                                     to draw on the client.
        template: "canvas_module.html" stores the module's HTML template.
