Modular Canvas Rendering
========================

Module for visualizing model objects in grid cells.

class CanvasGrid(VisualizationElement):
    """ A CanvasGrid object uses a user-provided portrayal method to generate a
    portrayal for each object. A portrayal is a JSON-ready dictionary which
    tells the relevant JavaScript code (GridDraw.js) where to draw what shape.

    The render method returns a dictionary, keyed on layers, with values as
    lists of portrayals to draw. Portrayals themselves are generated by the
    user-provided portrayal_method, which accepts an object as an input and
    produces a portrayal of it.

    A portrayal as a dictionary with the following structure:
        "x", "y": Coordinates for the cell in which the object is placed.
        "Shape": Can be either "circle", "rect" or "arrowHead"
            For Circles:
                "r": The radius, defined as a fraction of cell size. r=1 will
                     fill the entire cell.
            For Rectangles:
                "w", "h": The width and height of the rectangle, which are in
                          fractions of cell width and height.
            For arrowHead:
            "scale": Proportion scaling as a fraction of cell size.
            "heading_x": represents x direction unit vector.
            "heading_y": represents y direction unit vector.
        "Color": The color to draw the shape in; needs to be a valid HTML
                 color, e.g."Red" or "#AA08F8"
        "Filled": either "true" or "false", and determines whether the shape is
                  filled or not.
        "Layer": Layer number of 0 or above; higher-numbered layers are drawn
                 above lower-numbered layers.
        "text": The text to be inscribed inside the Shape. Normally useful for
                showing the unique_id of the agent.
        "text_color": The color to draw the inscribed text. Should be given in
                      conjunction of "text" property.


    Attributes:
        portrayal_method: Function which generates portrayals from objects, as
                          described above.
        grid_height, grid_width: Size of the grid to visualize, in cells.
        canvas_height, canvas_width: Size, in pixels, of the grid visualization
                                     to draw on the client.
        template: "canvas_module.html" stores the module's HTML template.
